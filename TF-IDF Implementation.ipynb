Yarbrough of the District of New Mexico.\\xa0 “Such a culture cannot, and will not, be tolerated.” \\xa0 “Correctional officers are given tremendous power to enforce the law.\\xa0 When that authority is abused, it's not just the civil rights of prison inmates that are threatened, but the public's trust in our democratic institutions as well,” said Carol K.O. Lee, Special Agent in Charge of the Albuquerque Division of the FBI.\\xa0 “The FBI, as the lead agency for investigating abuses of government officials, places a high priority on these cases.\\xa0 I would like to commend the FBI Special Agents who worked on this case, with the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office and the Metropolitan Detention Center's executive management and internal affairs staff.” \\xa0 This case was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney Fara Gold of the Civil Rights Division.\""

       "'U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. of the District of Colombia and Chief Cathy L. Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department announced that Bernard Freundel, a rabbi who had worked for a Jewish congregation in Washington, D.C., pleaded guilty today to 52 counts of voyeurism stemming from a series of incidents between 2009 and 2014 in which he secretly took video recordings of women preparing for a Jewish ritual bath. Freundel, 63, of Washington, D.C., pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges before the honorable Senior Judge Geoffrey M. Alprin in the superior court of the District of Columbia.\\xa0 Each count carries a maximum sentence of a year of incarceration, a fine of up to $1,000 or $2,500, for the offenses which occurred on or after June 11, 2013, or both.\\xa0 Freundel faces a maximum of 52 years in prison and the potential fines when he is sentenced on May 15, 2015. “Bernard Freundel exploited his position of power to victimize dozens of women who entered a sacred, intimate space of religious ritual,” said U.S. Attorney Machen.\\xa0 “He betrayed the trust of every woman whose private moments he caught on camera along with an entire community that counted on him for moral leadership.\\xa0 We hope that this guilty plea will allow each of his victims to move forward and heal.\\xa0 We will be seeking a prison sentence that reflects the gravity of this disturbing assault on the privacy and dignity of so many victims.” “This predator committed an outrageous breach of trust,” said Chief Lanier.\\xa0 “He must be punished for abusing his position to deliberately and repeatedly violate women’s privacy.\\xa0 My heart goes out to the victims and all members of the community who have been deeply wounded by this criminal’s actions.” According to a factual proffer submitted at today’s plea hearing, between early 2009 and October 2014, Freundel was the sole Rabbi of Kesher Israel congregation in Northwest Washington.\\xa0 Kesher Israel is adjacent to the National Capital Mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath. \\xa0A mikvah is used primarily by Orthodox Jewish women for monthly spiritual purification and by other individuals as the final step in the Orthodox Jewish conversion process. The National Capital Mikvah has two changing/showering rooms connected to the room with the ritual bath.\\xa0 On numerous occasions between early 2009 and October 2014, the defendant installed and maintained electronic recording devices in the larger of the two changing/showering rooms.\\xa0 Freundel did so for the sole purpose of secretly and surreptitiously recording women who were using the bathroom and shower; these women were totally and partially undressed before and/or after showering.\\xa0 The women recorded did not know they were being recorded and did not consent to being recorded. On Oct. 12, 2014, Freundel entered the larger changing/showering room with a clock radio that contained a hidden recording device.\\xa0 He placed the clock radio on the countertop of the sink and positioned the recording element so that it faced the shower area.\\xa0 He then left the changing area.\\xa0 Shortly thereafter, the clock radio was taken by an individual associated with the Mikvah, who immediately turned it over to the Metropolitan Police Department, leading to an investigation. \\xa0Freundel was arrested on Oct. 14, 2014.\\xa0 Law enforcement executed search warrants to examine the contents of the clock radio and to seek evidence at Freundel’s home and office at Towson University.\\xa0 Computer forensic examinations of all of the electronic devices and digital media storage devices seized from the defendant’s home and office revealed recordings made by the defendant of at least 52 women who were totally or partially undressed in the large showering/changing room of the Mikvah on a total of 25 different dates between March 4, 2012 and Sept. 19, 2014.\\xa0 These are the women who are the subjects of the charges to which Freundel pled guilty today.\\xa0 The charge of voyeurism has a three-year statute of limitations. In addition to the 52 recordings that were the subject of the plea, computer forensic examinations revealed that Freundel secretly and surreptitiously recorded approximately 100 additional women totally or partially undressed before and/or after showering in the large bathroom at the National Capital Mikvah between 2009 and September 2014.\\xa0 These women did not know that they were being recorded and did not consent to being recorded. In announcing the plea, U.S. Attorney Machen and Chief Lanier commended the work of those who investigated the case for the Metropolitan Police Department, including officers and detectives of the second police district. They also recognized the assistance provided by the Towson University Police Department.\\xa0 In addition, they acknowledged the efforts of those who worked on the case from the U.S. Attorney’s Office including Chief Jelahn Stewart of the Victim/Witness Assistance Unit, Deputy Chief Sharon Marcus-Kurn of the Sex Offense and Domestic Violence Section, Lead Paralegal Specialist Wanda Trice, Victim/Witness Advocate Lezlie Richardson, Victim/Witness Advocate Supervisor Dr. Lorraine Chase and Criminal Investigator John Marsh. Finally they expressed appreciation for the work of Assistant U.S. Attorneys Amy H. Zubrensky and Rebekah Holman, who investigated and prosecuted the case.'"

       "'Bernard “Barry” Freundel, 63, of Washington D.C., a rabbi who had worked for a Jewish congregation in Washington, D.C., was sentenced today to a prison term of six years and six months on 52 counts of voyeurism stemming from a series of incidents between 2009 and 2014 in which he secretly took video recordings of women preparing for a Jewish ritual bath. The sentence was announced by Acting U.S. Attorney Vincent H. Cohen Jr. of the District of Columbia and Chief Cathy L. Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Freundel pleaded guilty in February 2015 to the misdemeanor charges before the Honorable Senior Judge Geoffrey M. Alprin in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\\xa0 The sentencing came at the end of a three-hour hearing in which more than a dozen women told the court of the emotional impact they continue to endure because of Freundel’s abuse of his position of trust.\\xa0 Judge Alprin sentenced Freundel to 45 days in prison for each of the 52 victims, calling his actions “a classic abuse of power and violation of trust.” Freundel, who had been free on personal recognizance, was immediately taken into custody to begin serving his sentence. “Today the court heard the heart-wrenching accounts of the victims of Barry Freundel’s exploitation,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Cohen.\\xa0 “Their stories make clear the lasting scars that will be left by this outrageous abuse of power.\\xa0 This prosecution was an effort to restore the dignity that Barry Freundel tried to steal from these women.\\xa0 We hope that the scores of victims of his crimes will find some solace in the justice meted out by the court today.” “It is my hope that the many victims in this case draw a small measure of relief from the sentencing action today,” said Chief Lanier.\\xa0 “His actions wounded an entire religious community and showed a flagrant disregard for his position of trust within that community.\\xa0 I am confident that today’s action by the courts will serve to continue the healing process for the many unwitting victims of this predator.” According to a factual proffer submitted at the earlier plea hearing, between early 2009 and October 2014, Freundel was the sole rabbi of Kesher Israel congregation in Northwest Washington, D.C.\\xa0 Kesher Israel is adjacent to the National Capital Mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath.\\xa0 A mikvah is used primarily by Orthodox Jewish women for monthly spiritual purification and by other individuals as the final step in the Orthodox Jewish conversion process.
